## SOLID Design Principles
 
- `S`ingle Responsibility Principle
- `O`pen-Closed Principle
- `L`iskov Substitution Principle
- `I`nterface Segregation Principle
- `D`ependency Inversion Principle

S.O.L.I.D design principles introduced by Robert C. Martin

## The Patterns 
#### Cretional
- **Builder** <br> When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.
- **Factories** <br> A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.
    - Abstract Factory
    - Factory Method
- **Prototype** <br> A partially of fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of. 
- **Singleton** <br> A component which is instantiated only once
